CSC8502 Graphics Coursework
====

### Overview  

This project is what I submitted for my coursework in CSC8502.
I created two scenes.
This coursework is meant to render a scene at a time and then transition between the 2 scenes.
While in a rendered scene the camera can move around freely or with a key press rotate around the scene.
